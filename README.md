# TrainSchedule

For this project I was tasked with building a functioning train schedule app using the following languages and technologies: 

Firebase
CSS
Bootstrap
HTML
jQuery
Moment.js

I designed this app to be user friendly with a clean interface and experience. Sections of the site are separated by stylish borders and boxes. Under the title is a form that populates data being pulled from the firebase. The form is limited to the latest 10 records. Under the box of current train schedules is a box for hte user to create their own train. Several input fields are available with clear requirements and validations. 

When the user creates a train the app adds the data to firebase and the app is being updated every second so the times (moment.js) are current regardless of when the train was added.
